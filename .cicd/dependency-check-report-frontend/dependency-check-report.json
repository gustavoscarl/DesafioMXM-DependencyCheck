This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/commit\/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/commit\/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/pull\/5539\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/koajs\/koa\/issues\/1800\nhttps:\/\/expressjs.com\/en\/4x\/api.html#res.location","notes": "","references": [ {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/commit\/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/commit\/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2024-29041","name": "https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2024-29041"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/pull\/5539","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/pull\/5539"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/advisories\/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/advisories\/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/koajs\/koa\/issues\/1800","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/koajs\/koa\/issues\/1800"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/commit\/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/expressjs\/express\/commit\/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/expressjs.com\/en\/4x\/api.html#res.location","name": "https:\/\/expressjs.com\/en\/4x\/api.html#res.location"}],"vulnerableSoftware": [ {"software": { "id":"cpe:2.3:a:*:express:\\<4.19.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}}]}]}]}
